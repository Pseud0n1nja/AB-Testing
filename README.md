## Introduction

Welcome to the A/B Testing Repository! This repository is designed to provide a comprehensive framework for conducting A/B tests on content, users, and websites. Whether you're optimizing a landing page, testing new features, or improving user engagement, this repository has the tools and resources you need to design, implement, and analyze your experiments effectively.

With the rise of digital marketing powered by tools like Google Analytics, Google Adwords, and Facebook Ads, businesses are continuously seeking ways to gain a competitive edge. One of the most powerful tools at their disposal is A/B testing, which allows for the precise measurement of the effects of various digital marketing strategies. Small changes can lead to big effects, and A/B testing is the key to unlocking these opportunities.

A/B Testing enables us to determine whether changes in landing pages, popup forms, article titles, and other digital marketing elements improve conversion rates and ultimately enhance customer purchasing behavior. A successful A/B Testing strategy can lead to massive gains: more satisfied users, increased engagement, and higher sales - a win-win-win for businesses.


### Case Study 1: Traditional A/B Testing Using Statistical Methods

This case study explores the traditional approach to A/B testing using statistical inference methods such as z-scores and t-tests. The focus is on testing variations in website color schemes to determine which variation leads to higher user engagement.

#### Experiment Details:
- **Objective:** To determine the impact of different website color schemes on user engagement.
- **Methodology:** Traditional statistical A/B testing methods (e.g., z-score, t-test).
- **Outcome:** Identifying the most effective color scheme for improving user engagement.

### Case Study 2: A/B Testing Using Machine Learning for Enrollments/Course Completion

This case study delves into the application of Machine Learning for A/B Testing, specifically to increase course enrollments. The experiment is conducted by MOOC, a website dedicated to online teaching, with the overall business goal of maximizing course completion by students.

#### Experiment Name: "Free Trial" Popup

**Objective:** To maximize course completion by guiding students based on their weekly time commitment.

**Methodology:** 
- **Traditional Approach:** Students were taken through the checkout process based on their indicated weekly time commitment.
- **Machine Learning Approach:** Implemented advanced algorithms (Linear Regression, Decision Trees, XGBoost) to enhance the effectiveness of the screener and improve the enrollment process.

**Outcome:** Improved user guidance during the enrollment process, leading to higher course completion rates and better alignment between student expectations and course demands.

Traditional statistical approaches to A/B Testing, which rely on comparing only two variables (an experiment/control to an outcome), often fall short in capturing the complexities of customer behavior. Customers take different paths, spend varying amounts of time on sites, and come from diverse backgrounds. This is where Machine Learning excels, as it generates insights from complex systems and multifaceted customer journeys. By showcasing these two case studies, we aim to highlight the strengths and limitations of both approaches and demonstrate how Machine Learning can provide a more nuanced understanding of customer behavior.
